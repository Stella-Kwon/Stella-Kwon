# Hi, I'm Sumin Kwon 👋



Backend-oriented developer with a strong interest in system programming and networked applications.

I graduated from **Hive Helsinki (42 Network)** in **August 2025**, where I worked on project-based software development focused on operating systems, networking, and low-level problem solving. Most of my experience comes from building and debugging real programs in C/C++, and gradually extending that knowledge to backend web systems.

I’m particularly interested in how programs behave at runtime — process execution, resource management, and communication between components — and how those fundamentals translate into reliable backend services.

## What I’m Working On

- Exploring **network programming** and real-time communication
- Building a **collaborative reservation service** that gathers participants using polling techniques  
  - Backend: **Fastify**, **TypeScript**  
  - Mobile frontend: **React Native**
- Revisiting past projects to better understand design decisions and runtime behavior

## Selected Projects

### [Minishell](https://github.com/Stella-Kwon/Minishell)
A Unix shell implemented in C.

- Supports pipes, redirections, heredoc/herestring, and signal handling
- Handles process creation and execution using `fork`, `execve`, and `wait`
- Uses tokenizing and an AST-based structure to control command flow
- Debugged runtime issues using focused test cases and manual testing

---

### [ft_irc](https://github.com/Stella-Kwon/ft_irc)
A multi-client IRC server written in C++.

- Supports core IRC commands such as PRIVMSG, NOTICE, MOTD, and PING/PONG
- Handles message broadcasting to channels and direct user-to-user communication
- Uses an epoll-based event loop to manage multiple concurrent client connections

---

### [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Stella-Kwon/PingPongGame)
Backend components for a real-time web application.

- Implements WebSocket-based communication for real-time interactions
- Handles connection lifecycle and message routing on the backend
- Built with TypeScript and Fastify, in collaboration with frontend teammates

---

### [cub3d](https://github.com/Stella-Kwon/cub3d)
A simple 3D game engine inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*.

- Implemented in C using raycasting techniques
- Renders a 3D environment from a 2D map
- Handles player movement, textures, and a basic game loop
